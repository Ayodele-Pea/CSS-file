Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used to describe 
the presentation semantics (i.e. the look and formatting) of a document 
written in a markup language. CSS is designed primarily to enable the 
separation of document content (written in HTML or a similar markup 
language) from document presentation, including elements such as the 
colours, fonts, and layout.
